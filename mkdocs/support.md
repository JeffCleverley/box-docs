# Support Options for WPLib Box

As our goal is for WPlib Box to be your choice for local development and thus   
**we actively want to support you**. 
<br><br>
So please, do not be shy or worry you might be bothering us. Learning 
about your experience with WPLib Box  will allow us to make WPLib Box 
that much better for you, and for everyone else. 

## Slack for Urgent **and** Non-urgent Help
Please [**join our Slack**](https://launchpass.com/wplib) to get help direct 
from our team in our `#box` channel.  

And even if your needs are not urgent, we really do want to talk to you 
so we can learn how WPLib Box can better meet your needs.  

## One-on-One Help via GoToMeeting
We are currently offering **free one-on-one help sessions** via our GoToMeeting account. If you would 
like to take advantage of this opportunity &mdash; ==which probably won't last forever== &mdash;
just [**join our Slack**](https://launchpass.com/wplib) and then direct message the WPLib Box 
project lead `@mikeschinkel` to schedule a session.

## GitHub Issues for Documenting Concerns
After contacting us on Slack it is really helpful if you can fill out a 
[**new GitHub issue**](https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box/issues/new) for any bugs or feature requests 
to ensure we can track them until they are addressed.
