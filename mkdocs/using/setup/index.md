## Initial Setup for WPLib Box


These seem to be the ==most common needs== for new users when setting up WPLib Box:

- [Organizing your Project Directories](directories.md)
- [Configuring WPLib Box's Domain Name](hostname.md)

If you don't find what your use-case here be sure to check the [Using](/docs/using/) page.



## Configuration Options
WPLib Box can be configured by **using terminal commands** and by **modifying config files**.  

As of version `0.17.0` these are your configuration options _(many more configuration 
options will be available in the future):_ 

- The [`box` command](/using/box-command.md)
- [`project.json`](/using/project.json.md)
